        "Heaven, in its most tender form, is where love floats 
        on clouds and hearts whisper through the winds. It's a place 
        untouched by time, where souls entwine forever beneath a sky brushed 
        in hues of blush and gold. Here, every breeze carries a soft serenade,
         every sunset paints poetry in the air, and every moment feels like the first spark of love. 
         In this romantic haven, there's no endâ€”just an endless dance of togetherness, under
          stars that glow with the warmth of a thousand kisses."</strong></pre></font>
